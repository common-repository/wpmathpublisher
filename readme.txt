Plugin that allows formulars to be included in blog texts (as graphics)

== Description ==

WpMathPublish is a plugin that offers wordpress authors the funtion to convert mathematical equations into graphics being displayed in pages and blogentries.
To do so, it uses the [PhpMathPublisher](http://www.xm1math.net/phpmathpublisher/ "Authors Homepage")-Libary, which has been modifies to work with wordpress. 

**Using** it is just as simple as that:
Mathematical equations that are meant to be shown as such have to be put in [math]-tags using your favorite wordpress-editor ([math]equation[/math]). The plugin automatically converts the equations into graphics, which will be saved in your wordpress installtion in order to be generated only once. A small overview over its functions is integrated in the admin menu as well

*Attention:* Previous versions of this plugin used [m]-tags instead of the [math]-tags. These still are supported, but i thought it was much nicer to have [math]-tags

Currently it supports the following **features**:

*   Basic function: Convert equations into graphics
*   Font and background color can be chosen by you in the admin panel (alpha-transparency included, but if you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer you will need version 7 or greater to display the images correctly)
*   Font size default value can be set, but also changed for every single image if necessary
*   If you just want to output a formula there is a "noparse" attribute that will output the pure text nicely formatted
*   Saves the images on the webspace, which saves processor time
*   Clear image cache and let all images be regenerated by admin panel
*   Integration in TinyMCE editor

**Configuration**:

To configure the plugin there is an easy to use admin panel page (since v0.3.1).
Here you can change the the color by using a javascript color picker, and the transparency value for the graphic
Furthermore you can choose a default font-size used for the images

**Commands**:

There are probably quite a lot people who do not know the PhpMathPublisher commands, so [here](http://www.xm1math.net/phpmathpublisher/doc/help.html "Documentation on the authors Homepage") you go.

**Translation**:

The plugin ist currently available in

*   English (default)
*   German (translated by me)
*   Belorussian (by [Marcis G](http://pc.de/ "Marcis G."))
*   Romanian (by [Web Hosting Geeks](http://webhostinggeeks.com/ "Web Geek Sciense"))
